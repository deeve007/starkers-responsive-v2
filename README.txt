	This is completely rebuilt version 2 from the
	ground up, based once again on the original
	Starkers, but with a much improved responsive
	CSS framework and other features.
	
	Version 1 for reference:

	Starkers from Elliot Jay Stocks / Viewport 
	Industries has long been my favourite Wordpress
	blank starter theme. I tried others over time
	but kept coming back to it again and again.
	
	But I found myself always adding the same basic 
	features to start off every single project: 
	dropdown menu, sidebar, thumbnails
	
	And more recently, any new site had to be 
	responsive of course. If you're not building
	responsive sites yet then you need to start now!
	
	And finally, since I had to edit the template
	code a little in order to responsify the theme,
	I chose to add a little extra HTML5 goodness.
	
	I'm sure it's not perfect, I'm sure it can be
	improved a lot, which hopefully I can do over
	time. Please feel free to recommend any 
	improvements that could be made.
